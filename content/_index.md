Here you can find my writing on tech, privacy, and cybersecurity - with the ocassional personal thing or two thrown in here and there.

As I spend most of my day job doing cloud and mainframe things, naturally they're going to most likely be written about a lot. With that said, the usual disclaimer: all opinions are entirely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.

I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I don't want to spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here - whether it's to tell me you liked it and want to discuss it further, have a question, or because you want to argue with me and tell me I'm wrong, you can send an email to <blog@fitzsimons.dk>

This site doesn't contain any JavaScript, tracking pixels, analytics, sign-up forms, or newsletter links, as I'm not looking to build an audience, or see who that audience might be. **The main goal of this site is to force myself to write/learn in public** because then it means everything ends up a bit more polished than my own notes I keep to myself.

If you spot any errors (spelling or otherwise) in anything written across this site, please do get in touch and I'll fix it as soon as possible.
